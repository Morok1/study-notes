# study-notes
This repository contains notes on various courses given in NRU ITMO.
Reading `.org` files is much simpler when using emacs + org.

There are lots of scans that are available here:

* https://www.dropbox.com/sh/zuup54c9huc8z85/AABrJgmAkJTuZczceKW5O3PBa?dl=0

Please contribute, especially if you have:
  * Found any semantic errors
  * Found any typos/misspellings
  * Found some too informal text that should be deleted (I'm sorry for that)
  * Used this repo and it helped you a lot (I'd be really grateful for any additions/fixes/improvements)
